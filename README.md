#  Sustainable Farming Platform

The **Sustainable Farming Platform** is a modern web-based solution designed to support farmers and agricultural communities by providing digital tools, resources, and insights for sustainable agricultural practices. This project is built with **React, TypeScript, and Vite**, with a strong focus on performance, scalability, and clean UI components.

The platform acts as a foundation for building features such as crop advisory, weather integration, learning resources, and interactive dashboards. It aims to serve as a knowledge-sharing and decision-support system for farmers, researchers, and policymakers.
